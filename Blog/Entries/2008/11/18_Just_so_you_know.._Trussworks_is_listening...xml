    <richText>Since there was a little unexpected (and unwelcome) "breather" in the beginning of November, we took the opportunity to address an issue we have been regularly saying "NO" to. We know you all love the EZ6 truss but wish it could span further. There are a few issues that are just unresolvable to make that happen BUT we have been working on a solution. It's a cross between EZ6 and EZ12. Easily spans 20' (shown below). Does not fold flat since the 12" x 6" rectangular profile is pretty compact. It also weighs less than EZ12.&#xD;&#xD;It does require 4 carriage bolts and wingnuts per connection but it is still way faster than any competitive products *cough, cough, Skyline, cough*.. The freestanding arch in the photo below is 9' to the top and is 19'2" between the uprights. The uprights are standard EZ6. This arch ships in 2 flat pack cases and easily supports a centered load of 250# (email back if you need to see proof of this loading). The parts will include the EZ6 column top which is like a cube connector in function, 11.5", 23", 34.5" and 46" straight sections as well as 30&#xB0; and 45&#xB0; 51.75" radius sections and a new 22.5&#xB0; 9' radius section. &#xA0;Look for a bunch of cool kits showcasing this product in the near future!&#xD;&#xD;Roy&#xD;Trussworks</richText>
