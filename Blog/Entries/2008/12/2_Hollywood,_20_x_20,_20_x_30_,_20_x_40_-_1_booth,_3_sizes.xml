    <richText>The Hollywood was designed with 2 goals in mind. Make a statement with huge graphics and reconfigure simply using everything! To do this we created 2 similar structures that crisscross each other in a 20 x 20 or 20 x 30 space but sit next to each other in larger spaces. We also decided to show an option letting the truss frame the mega-graphics which saves quite a bit of graphic cost.&#xD;&#xD;Attached find 5 different configurations of the Hollywood. 2 each 20 x 20s, 1 with full graphics, the other with truss framing it. The other 3 are a 20 x 30 and 2 - 20 x 40 configurations. Also consider just using one structure at about half the cost!&#xD;&#xD;Retail for the hardware with 16 lights and 3 tubs - $18,410&#xD;Graphics @ $22 / sq. ft.&#xD;Beam graphics assuming covering both sides of all 4 beams. - $3,572&#xD;Full panel graphics (8 total) &#xA0;- $14,884&#xD;		or&#xD;Framed panel graphics (again 8 total) - $12,244&#xD;&#xD;Accessories shown add up to $5,665 and include 11 chairs, a table, 3 counters, aand an additional beam with a plasma mount. Another tub or two would be required for all this.&#xD;&#xD;Thanks for looking! All the specs for the new kits will be on our site soon!</richText>
