    <richText>Exhibitor 2010 - Building on the popular EZ612 Irvine / Hillcrest convex curve design, we extended the top curve forward into a ceiling supported by Hyperlite corner modules, we created an environment inside our booth which was somewhat insulated from the noise and lights of the show. It gave us a great place to demo our products and catch up with our distributors and old friends. &#xD;&#xD;This was the first time we had used the curve in an island, doing graphics inside and out and it was a challenge. Optima rose to the challenge perfectly fitting the outside radius with a 19&#x2019;2&#x201D; wide x 10&#x2019;8&#x201D; high Trussworks banner. This was installed with our banner clips and every time I looked around the back of the booth, it had drawn an audience. Not bad for a static image. &#xD;&#xD;Since we had most of our office staff at the show, we had to build in a small office. We did this out of Hyperlite and incorporated our overhead sign as well as a demo station on each side and placed PackStuff our front. While the office detracted from the design it proved to be quite useful and I don&#x2019;t think many people recognized it as an afterthought. &#xD;&#xD;Our front counter was also a hit with many of our distributors. It was simple but impactful as were our beautiful Iris and silver pack stools. Click on the booth above to check out the photo library. &#xD;</richText>
