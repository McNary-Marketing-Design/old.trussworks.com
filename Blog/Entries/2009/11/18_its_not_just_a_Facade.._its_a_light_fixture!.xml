    <richText>Hi Everyone!&#xD;&#xD;Man, it has been a brutal year but we're still here plugging away. We have been having some early success with our Hyperlite extrusion system due to the ease of assembly and felt like we can build on that simplicity by adding something totally new and unique. These new Hyperlite kits are the beginning of an entire new line of displays. Although you can't see the hardware, we are using the easy to assemble Hyperlite extrusions with the flat truss horizontals. But instead of showing that, we created 2 pc. laminated expanded PVC columns which mount to the extrusions. These columns also support and hide florescent strip lights which do a very nice job of lighting the large graphic panels or the built-in shelving. Optional column accessories include a perf metal sconce, small product shelves, monitor mounts and literature pockets. The horizontal trusses are still there to provide the structure to mount headers to and support the large fabric graphics. In keeping with all of our newer products, these kits are tool-less and pack in plastic shipping cases.&#xD;&#xD;So.. introducing the first 3 kits of the Hyperlite Facade line.&#xD;The 10 x 10 Silhouette - retail as shown including graphics - $6,022&#xD;The 10 x 20 Sabre - retail as shown including graphics - $15,350&#xD;The 10 x 20 Navigator - retail as shown including graphics - $13,409&#xD;&#xD;We have put alot of energy into this new line are very excited about them and truly hope it will help you all increase your sales. Please feel free to contact us with questions on these or any of our other products.&#xD;&#xD;Roy&#xD;</richText>
